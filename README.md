# Bank-Loan-Prediction
A ML project to predict whether the bank will approve the loan or not


Bank loan prediction using machine learning involves developing models that can predict whether a customer is likely to be approved or denied a loan based on various features and historical data. Here's a summary of the typical steps involved in the process:

Data Collection:

Gathering relevant data, including historical loan application data, customer information, credit scores, income details, employment history, and any other relevant features.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Cleaning the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing any necessary transformations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploring and analyzing the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, relationships, and potential patterns.
Identify any correlations between features and the target variable (loan approval status).
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Feature engineering might involve creating interaction terms, binning variables, or extracting meaningful information.

Model Selection:

Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task. Common models for binary classification problems like loan prediction include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting algorithms.

Model Training:

Spliting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the selected models on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Use the testing dataset to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Then Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model to improve its performance.
This may involve using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

Deployment:

Deploying the trained model for making predictions on new loan applications.
Integrate the model into the existing banking system or application.
